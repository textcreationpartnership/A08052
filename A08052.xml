            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Some of our companie went a fiſhing in a ſmall <note place="margin">Of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of fiſh.</note> cocke, with a nette which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirall had brought with him, and we found that there was wonderfull plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fiſh, ſo that at one draft we tooke néere two barrels and a halfe of fiſh, and could hardly draw the net, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great number of fiſhes therein: and we tooke euerie day ſo great quantitie of fiſh, that we were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpend the ſame while it was freſh and ſweet. Here we took a Chorn-backe that was ſo big, that wee, with the Marriners of our ſhip, had ſufficient to eate thereof at two meales.</p>
               <p>Here are great numbers of Torteyſes, which are ſo big, that 4 of vs might ſtand vpon ſome one Torteyſe, and yet it crept away with vs, in the ſhelles or ſhieldes whereof, tenne of vs haue had roome to ſit.</p>
               <p>This Iſland is very fruitfull, and plentifull of fowles, <note place="margin">The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie of Cerne.</note> as of Turtle Doues, whereof there are ſuch plentie, that 3. of vs haue in one afternoone taken 150. and if wee had beene able to carrie them, we might haue taken more with our bare hands, &amp; killed them with cudgels. There are alſo great plenty of ruſſet Parrets, &amp; of other colours: there are alſo other great fowles, as big as our Swans, hauing great heads, &amp; vpon their heads a ſkin, as if they had caps on their heads: they haue no wings at all, but in place of wings, they haue 3. or 4. black quils, and where their taile ſhould be, they haue 4. or 5. ſmall curled fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; their colour is grayiſh. Wee named theſe fowles Walghfowle (partly becauſe they were tough in eating, how long time ſoeuer they ſod: yet the crop &amp; breaſt were very good meat) but ſpecially becauſe we could take ſtore of Turtle Doues, which were more delectable in taſte.</p>
               <p>There are yet other ſorts of fowles good to bee eaten, which are called <hi>Rabos Forcados,</hi> becauſe their tayles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13461:11"/>
are like in faſhion to a taylers ſhéeres. Theſe fowles are ſo tame, that a man may take them with his hands as they ſate on their neſt, and alſo kill them with ſtaues and cudgels, inſomuch that in the ſpace of one halfe howre, we could fill a boate with them: whereby we preſumed that there had neuer béene any people in the Iſland, for the birdes ſhunned no man, yea, they ſcarcely would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to come and ſit on our heades, and ſo ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee taken.</p>
               <p>In this Iſland we did ſet vp a Smithes ſorge, where our Smith made and mended ſome Iron workes, and the Shipwrights made alſo a boate for the <hi>Vtricht,</hi> for ſhe had loſt her boat before Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> Iſland.</p>
               <p>In this Iſle <hi>de Cerne</hi> before mentioned, we found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300. pound waight of waxe, whereon ſtood Gréeke Letters. We found alſo a Netting, with a Capſten bar, and a great Maineyard: whereby iudged, that ſome ſhip had there ſuffered wracke.</p>

aforeſaid three ſhips, a fourth (namely the great Pinnaſe called the <hi>Vrieſland,</hi> wherof <hi>Iacob Corneliſſon</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and <hi>Wouter Willekens</hi> Commiſſioner, laded in this place for <hi>Holland:</hi> all which foure ſhips being fully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, gaue notice to all men of the town, that they would depart homewardes, and that therefore all ſuch as they ought any money vnto, ſhould come and receiue their payment.</p>

At this place they bartred kniues, ſpoones, looking glaſſes, bels &amp; néedels, for many things, and much fruit; as Millons, Cucumbers, Onions, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and ſome ſmall ſtore of Pepper, but excellent good.</p>
                  <p>Some fewe dayes before the departure from <hi>Bantam</hi> of theſe foure ſhips, the other foure that had determined to ſéeke their lading further, and to that end to ſayle to the Ilands of <hi>Moluccos,</hi> tooke leaue of the ſaid laden ſhips, and the ſame night wherein they ſet ſayle to depart, they thundred ſuch a peale of ordinance, that it was heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the Iland, and the whole towne of <hi>Bantam</hi> was vp in armes, not knowing what the meaning thereof was: and thus theſe eyght ſhips parted from cath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The people of <hi>Bantam</hi> were very glad that they were gone: for euerie day they would inquire of vs when wee would depart: and to haſten our departure, they vſed all diligence to deliuer vs ſuch wares as we had bought, for it was nothing at all pleaſant vnto them, to sée vs lie there with eight ſhips together.</p>
                  <p>The foure ſhips aforeſaid ſayled from <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and came to the Iland of <hi>S. Helena,</hi> where they refreſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>From this Island we ſayled, and in ſhort time, without any miſaduenture, arriued in the Texell the 19 day of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 1599.

                  <p>The Marchants and venturers of the ſhips went with all ſpéede to the Texell, to order all things aboord the ſaid ſhips, and to refreſh the Marriners.

                  <p>THe 1. of Nouem we met with another ſtorm at ſea, with <note place="margin">Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> much raine, &amp; mighty wind, wherby our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirall, the ſame night with the great Pinnaſe, loſt our company.</p>

The <note place="margin">13</note> ſame night dyed one of our folk in the ſhip of the Deane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Chapter of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> which was the firſt man that dyed in the fléet.</p>
                  <p>The 6. day of the ſaid Moneth in the afternoone, there came néere vnto our ſhip a ſpoute, which is a whirle wind that taketh and carrieth the water vp out of the ſea, which falling into a ſhip, will carrie away all things that are looſe, and indaunger the ſhip: wherefore we tooke in our ſailes with all ſpéed, tearing leaſt perhaps they might therby receiue ſome dammage, &amp; in ſtriking of the maine yard, our principall ſayle-maker, called <hi>Iooſt Janſon</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> looking ouer-boord, to ſée if any part of the ſayle hung in the water, ſuddenly (as he was putting his head ouer the ſhips ſide) the mayne yarde fell looſe from the maſt aboue, and ſmote the ſaid <hi>Iooſt Ianſon</hi> on his head ſtarke dead, which was a great miſchance, and he was the firſt man that dyed this voyage in that ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The 7. day in the morning we caſt the ſaid <hi>Iooſt Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ouer-boord.</p>
                  <p>The 9. day his goods were ſold before the maine maſt, which were well ſolde, for that one Ryail of 8. was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for 8. Gildernes and a halfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day wee were put to our firſt allowance of Oyle, to wit, wéekely two Mutſkins, which maketh of our wine meaſure about halfe a pinte.</p>
                  <p>The 12. day the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirall came aboord our ſhip to miniſter iuſtice, which was the firſt execution of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that he did in theſe ſhips. The ſame day we had ſight of an Iſland, and were in the night come néere to the land before we wiſt thereof, for it was a very low land: then we diſcharged a péece to warne the other ſhips thereof, &amp; then wended and put roome-ward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13461:18"/>
The 13 day we ſaw thrée other ſmall Ilands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the little Pinnaſe ſayled that euening before vs, to ſee if we might ſaile on the farther ſide of one of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands or not, but the water was too ſhallow, for there lay out a great necke or corner of the Iſland, therefore wee caſt about to ſeaward, and the ſame euening we caſt our ſounding lead in the firſt quarter, and had 20. faddome, and caſting the lead againe, found but 15. faddome, the third time 11. faddome, and the fourth time 9. faddome, inſomuch that we were in great danger of the ſholes, but God preuented the ſame, for we held our ſhip turning, and ſuddenly came into the deepe, eſcaping the great danger wee were in, to loſe our ſhip and our liues: for, doubting greatly that we ſhould méet with great ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts betwéene the Iſlands, we were drawne out of the right way, and brought into this error.</p>
                  <p>The 15. day wee had againe ſhallowe water at 13. faddome, but wee were out of ſight of any land, which was a great wonder to finde ſuch a ſhallow in the Sea ſo farre from any ſhore, for we could not ſée any land at all.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, we had againe a faire winde, ſo that we muſt hale in our ſheates, and ſet our courſe Eaſt and by South, and Eaſt Southeaſt: the ſame day we ſhot a great Toonny, whereof there were in that place very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wherewith we made good chéere.</p>
                  <p>The 16. day of the ſaide moneth in the morning, wée had ſight of another Iſland, ſo that we let ſlip our ſheates to ſayle beyond it. This Iland ſtretcheth to the South and North, and lyeth very low, and pleaſantly to ſée to: in the euening we were paſt this Iſland, and pulled in again our ſheates: we held our courſe moſt Eaſt and by South, and Eaſt Southeaſt.</p>
                  <p>The 22. day in the afternoone wee had much rayne with a ſtouts gale of winde, ſo that wée were conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to take in our top-ſailes, the ſame night it lightened wonderfully.</p>
                  <p>The 24. day the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admiral gaue ſigne by putting out his ſtreamer or banderoll, that all the Pilots ſhould come aboord him, to take counſell together what courſe were beſt to be kept.</p>
                  <p>The 25. 26. and 27. dayes, wee had very ſtill and calme weather, but towards the euening the wind came South ſouthweſt, and wee helde our courſe moſt Eaſt ſoutheaſt.</p>
                  <p>The 28. day in the morning the wind ſlacked, and we directed our courſe Eaſt, and Eaſt, and by North: wee turned by the wind, the weather being very faire, in the night the winde came Weſterly, ſo that we ſhaped our courſe Eaſt ſoutheaſt, and Southeaſt and by Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>The 30. day the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirals preacher came aboord our ſhippe, where hee made vnto vs a godly and learned Sermon.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day of December we had the wind faire, and <note place="margin">Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> the ſame day wee began firſt to eate of our ſmoaked or dryed fleſh, which remained as yet very good and ſwéete.</p>
                  <p>The 2. 4. 5. 6. and 7. dayes we had calme and ſtill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with variable winds, and ſome while a pretie little gale, and ſometimes ſmall ſhowres of rayne: this day we might beholde ſquales and ſnakes driuing in the water, whereby we knew that we were néere vnto the land.</p>
                  <p>The 8. day wee had alſo mutable windes with ſome ſmall ſhowres and guſts of rayne, with thunder, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being very ſtill and calme, and towards the euening it began to blow a fine ſwéete gale from the Weſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, ſo that we haled in our ſheates, and held our courſe Eaſt ſoutheaſt: the ſame night a flying fiſh came flying into our ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The 9. day it blew a fine gale, the wind weſterly, and
<pb facs="tcp:13461:19"/>
we held our courſe for the moſt part Eaſt Southeaſt: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noonetide one of our company fell from the ſprit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile yard, and was drowned, for before we could hoyſe out our boat, he ſunke: his name was <hi>Gerbrand Iacobſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> of <hi>Alckmar,</hi> and a common marriner. There fell another ouer-boord alſo, who was one of the vnder Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights, and was browned with the other. His name was <hi>Tymon Ianſzen</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> ſo that this day we loſt two of our company.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day alſo dyed one aboord the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and one aboord the Pinnaſe: Thus in this one day we loſt foure men in in our fléete of fiue ſhips.</p>
                  <p>The 10. day the wind continued fayre, ſhaping our courſe moſt Eaſt Southeaſt, the weather faire: at noone we tooke the height, and found we were eight degrées to the South of the Equinoctiall line.</p>
                  <p>The 12. 13. and 14. dayes continued faire weather, except new &amp; then a little miſſing raine, and the ſame day we ſaw multitudes of birds, and scum of the ſea, driuing vpon the water, which cauſed vs to iudge that wee were not far from the land.</p>
                  <p>The 21. day our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirals boate came aboord vs, at which time happened an extreme ſtorme of winde and rayne, ſo that wee were conſtrained to take in our top ſailes: and becauſe the ſtorme continued long, it was thought good to take in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirals boate afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, fearing leaſt our boat ſhould haue drawne her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water: wherfore we caſt about to Lée-ward, to take in the boat, but in hoyſing it ouer, the rope, which was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened before to the boat, brake, and therewith one of the quarter maſters fell ouer boord, but we help him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſaued his life.</p>
                  <p>The 25. day in the night, about thrée houres before day-light, we had a ſhrewd guſt of raine and wind, ſo

                  <p>The 26. day in the morning wee could ſée but 2. of our <note place="margin">15</note> ſhippes, but in the euening we came againe together, and with our fore-ſailes euery one of vs put loofe, fearing wee ſhould come too néere the ſholes, and the Moone was ſo barke, that we could hardly diſcerne the length of a ſhip from vs.</p>
                  <p>The 27. day in the morning wee put out againe all our ſatles to make more way, hauing a fine full gale from the Weſt Northweſt with faire weather, and at afternoone we ſaw an Iſland called the <hi>Iſle de Gano,</hi> wherewith we were all greatly comforted and reioyced. The ſame night wee had a very hard tempeſt with contrary winds, which laſted two houres, and then the winde was againe good, and we ſhaped directly our courſe towards the maine land of <hi>Sumatra.</hi>

                  <p>The 29. day in the morning wee had a ſhrewd guſt of rayne and winde, with very darke weather.

The Admiral ſéeing that the ſaid boat ſtayed ſo long away, and returned not, ſent a cocke-boat with thrée men to the ſhore, to know the cauſe why the other ſtayed ſo long fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhips. Theſe 3. men were no ſooner come to the ſhore, but they were alſo taken priſoners by the inhabitants of the ſaid towne, and carried to their fellowes. After that they were thus dealt with, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commitees which were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this ſort among the reſt, obtained of the king licence to ſend 3. of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnto their Admiral, to aduertiſe him of this impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conditionally, that the ſaid 3. men ſhould preſently returne to the towne, after they had béene aboord their ſhipe: which was accordingly agréed and accompliſhed. After that the Admiral vnderſtood of theſe proceedings, he ſent a boat vnto the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirall to aduertiſe him hereof. Who preſently waying his anchors, droue downe the ſtreame vntill he came before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaid towne <hi>Arosbay,</hi> where the mariners were impriſoned. Euery day letters were ſent to &amp; fro, to come to ſome agréement for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty of our people: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> K. demanded a great ranſom, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 2. blacke péeces of ordinance which were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admiral, ſome nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of cloths, &amp; péeces of veluet, W<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 1000. rials of 8
<pb facs="tcp:13461:26"/>
This demand pleaſed the Admiral nothing at all, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if they would content themſelues with money or wares, hee would with all his heart agrée with them: but as touching the Ordinance by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> demanded, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not vnto him, neither had he any power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they belonged vnto his land, or ſtate of whence hée was. This maner of parle continued in this ſort fiue or ſixe daies, and euery day their demands were more vnreaſonable then other. In the end the Admirall called all the Marchants and maſters aboord him, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling together what was beſt to bée done. Then they concluded to land ſome of their company, and with force of armes to deliuer the priſoners, (for wee were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that our men were kept in the long boate wherewith they went aſhore, as yet lying in the hauen before the gate, without bonds, fetters, or cloſe priſon) meaning ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, and before they of the towne ſhould be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs, to deliver our men: but we failed of our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The 5. day of Februarie, after we had very well and in good order with 150. men manned and armed thrée long boats, and thrée ſhip boates, we rowed to the ſhore, where wee found a great multitude of people before the towne, among whom were two Portingals, who came vnto vs with flags of peace or truce in their hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would agrée with vs: which was nothing but deceit and knauerie, for they aſſembled themſelues verie ſtrongly within the towne. Whereupon ſome twentie of our Muſkettiers leapt on land, diſcharging their muſkets among the thickeſt, ſo that thrée or foure of them fell downe dead: and running towardes the place where the long boat lay with the priſoners, our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Admirall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto vs to returne into our owne boat, and to bring her in néerer vnto the towne, which we did: in the meane while the townſmen were come out at another gate, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13461:26"/>
to enuiron vs, and ſo to encloſe vs in the hauen, that we ſhould not be able to returne. We perceiuing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſent preſently two of our boats to the bome or barre, to kéepe the hauen frée for our returne: for if the enemie could haue poſſeſſed the corner, it would haue returned to our great hurt. While wee were thus in ſkirmiſh one with the other, they had cléered their braſſe Baſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them very terribly among vs, they had alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calieuers, and great ſtore of Bowes and arrowes, wherewith they ſhot among vs, ſo that it ſéemed that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes rained vpon vs: they thought as ſoone as our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſpent, to deale eaſily ynough with vs, but wée ſtayed not ſo long, by reaſon that the weather beganne to grow very tempeſtuous, the water was much falne, and beſides we thought good no longer to hazard our liues in vaine, wherefore we retyred to our boats, and pulling vp the dregs, rowed out of the hauen towards our ſhips, for the wind began to riſe more and more: and beeing ſome ſhot off from the land, the Admirals boat with 36 men, and the boat of the <hi>Zealand</hi> with 13. men, were with the waues &amp; billowes turned topſie-furuy and ouerthrowne: wee that were in the other boates were not able to helpe them, for it was as much as we were able to doe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue our owne boats aboue water, ſo that many a man came to his end by this miſhap, ſome being drowned, and others killed by the wilde people on the ſhore, but ſome that hapned to ſwim to the one ſide of the towne, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the <hi>Renegado</hi> of <hi>Tuban,</hi> which ſtoode by as the men came to land, and intreated for their liues, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people to take them priſoners: whereupon they were ſuffered to come to the land: and knéeling on the ground, the people laid ſand on their heads, in token that their liues were ſaued, but ſo many as ſwoome to the other ſide of the land, were put to the ſword without mercie,

The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter and the Corporall were bound and fettered, the reſt were bound together, and three of them were ſhrewdly wounded, &amp; thoſe which we meant to haue reſcued, were carried to other places, ſeparated in two companies.</p>

               <p>The eight day we beganne againe to parle about the priſoners ranſome: and in the end it was agréed to pay 2000. péeces of Rials of eight, in ſpice or in wares at the Kings pleaſure.</p>

               <p>The moſt part of the Inhabitants are commonly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, of <hi>Mahomets</hi> religion or beliefe, wherin they haue ſo great deuotion, that they will not go the watch, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from it, before they haue made and poured out their
<pb facs="tcp:13461:36"/>
praiers &amp; orizons in their Temples, which in their ſpeach they call <hi>Muſquita,</hi> alwayes waſhing their feete before they enter into their ſaid <hi>Muſquitas,</hi> (for commonly they haue great pots filled with water before their ſaid <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas)</hi> wherewith they clenſe &amp; waſh them ſelues: which done, they go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church or temple, where pouring out their prayers with cryings &amp; howlinges, yea ſo lowd, that a man may heare them verie eaſely aboue 20. houſes from their <hi>Muſquitas,</hi> pronouncing theſe wordes for the moſt part two or three times: <hi>Stofferolla, Stofferolla, Aſcehad an la, Aſcehad an la, Yll la, Aſcehad an la, Yll lol la, Yll lol la, Machumed die roſsulla.</hi> And as they pronounce the laſt word, they ſtrike their face with their hand: in which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonie, they haue great deuotion. They vſe alſo other prayers, which they vtter not with voyce, but mumble them and iumble them ſoftly to themſelues in a very ſtrange manner: ſuch prayers ended, and hauing ſpread a matte on the earth, they ſtand thereon, caſting their eyes twiſe or thrice vp toward the heauens, and then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on their knees, they lay their heads three or foure times on the ground. This ceremonie they vſe often, both in their <hi>Muſquitas,</hi> in their houſes, &amp; alſo openly abroad.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitantes meete often times together in their <hi>Muſquitas,</hi> bringing their victuals with them: where they make good cheere, and feaſt one another. They vſe the like feaſtinges often times in the Woodes, aſſembling ſometimes 100. perſons in a companie, to make good cheere, and to be merrie togither: of ſuch aſſemblies they make great accompt, taking great delight, pleaſure, and contentment therein: and commonly ſuch meetinges are vſed, when they will conferre together of common wealth matters, and ſuch like, of ſome waight or moment.</p>
               <p>They make ſharpe warres one againſt an other, yea the townes lying ſcant a mile or leage diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> each other,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13461:36"/>
are deuided. This enimitie hath continued long &amp; many yeeres in this Iland, for that they of <hi>Lambetack</hi> (a towne ſituated ſome litle leage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Nera,</hi> the principalleſt towne of the whole Iland) heretofore cut downe, or ouerthrew certaine trees within the circut or liberties of <hi>Nera:</hi> from hence I ſay, ſuch mortall hate, and bloodie warres hath ſo long ſince taken ſuch deepe roote in the hartes of thoſe people, that neuer ſince they could be reconciled, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all mercie, or ſparing one another, or keeping of any quarter, vpon all aduantages &amp; ſtratagems, they murther and kill one an other like Dogs, as wee in the time of our beeing there, haue often and ſundry times ſeene. In the night they keepe very ſtrong watch as well in the woods, as within their townes, calling &amp; crying one to an other all the night long, to thend they ſhould not fall a ſleepe.</p>
               <p>Now when they meane to make any attempt, or to take any enterpriſe in hand, commonly they come with their Gallies, which they row ſo ſwiſtly as a Shippe can ſayle with a reaſonable gale of winde. Theſe Gallies do great ſeruice: neither are they altogether ignorant in the vſe of their Baeſſes, whereof euery Gallie hath two of braſſe.</p>
               <p>They vſe alſo Hand-gunnes, or Caleeuers, in their warres, with ſundry other inſtruments and weapons, as Sheeldes, with a great Sable, called in their language <hi>Padaug,</hi> which they handle and vſe in very good ſort, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their children while they are young, to fight &amp; play at fence. They haue alſo Pikes commonly in their wars, made of very hard wood, which they caſt very certainely and neare, as we our ſelues haue often times ſeene. They haue alſo an other kind of weapon moſt common &amp; vſuall among them, the end is of Iron, made like vnto a ſmall harping-yron, wherein they put a ſticke, faſtning thervnto a little thinne coard, which they throw into the bodyes of their enemies when they come neare togither, and draw
<pb facs="tcp:13461:37"/>
it to them againe with the ſtring: when they go againſt their enemies, they ſet a murrion or head piece vpon their head, whereof they haue good ſtore among them, wearing in them commonly a Parradice bird in ſtead of a feather, thinking themſelues ſure and ſafe enough when they haue ſuch an helmet on their head. Some of the Gentlemen haue Corſlets or harneſſe, wherein they thinke they can take no hurt of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Now when they enterpriſe any attempt with their Gallies, they make a moſt hideous noyſe with crying, calling, hooping, hallowing, playing on Drums, and Baſon, as if they were all out of their wittes: the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (ſtanding aloft in the Gallie with their weapons in their hands) make many crooked leapes, ſpringing this way &amp; that way: he which can ſpring beſt, thinkes himſelfe the trimmeſt fellow, and is not a little proud thereof. On the ſides of the Gallies are ſtages of Canes, made to paſſe euen with the water, whereon the ſlaues ſit to row, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſkoope &amp; ſhouell the water, for in ſtead of Oares they vſe ſhouels made of wood, 2. or 3. ſitting together, ſhouell vp the water, &amp; caſting the ſhouel ouer their heads, poure out the water ouer the ſide of the Gallie: in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they make a wonderfull noyſe with ſinging, after their manner: others ſitting by them, which play vpon Drums, &amp; ſomtimes vpon Baſons alſo. They are very ſubtill and <note place="margin">The diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the people.</note> ſtout men in their warres, ſeeking and viſiting their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with great courage and aſſurance, as we ſaw our ſelues at what time they of <hi>Labbetacke</hi> came with foure Gallies before <hi>Nera,</hi> euen right before our lodging, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſkirmiſh moſt brauely to each other on the land, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome were ſlaine &amp; ſome hurt. This ſpited the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Nera,</hi> who in reuenge, taking the opportunitie of <note place="margin">The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the people of Nera a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies of Waygar.</note> the time rowed out the next morning with 5. Gallies to a little Iland named <hi>Waygar</hi> (the people whereof kept
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13461:37"/>
watch that night in <hi>Labbetacke</hi> (for they are confederats, &amp; hold with thoſe of <hi>Labbetacke)</hi> where they put to the ſword moſt of the people that were in the ſaid Iland, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads from thence with them to <hi>Nera,</hi> faſtened one by another to a rope, for their greater glory &amp; triumph, which they hold with all their pompe of flags, ſtreamers, banners, pennons, &amp; banderels, ſhooting very luſtily with their Baeſſes that lay in their Gallies. They alſo brought with them a woman priſoner, which the <hi>Sabander</hi> of the Iland kept for his ſlaue. They alſo brought an other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with them, but they cut her in the midle in two pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with a Sable or Curtlar, in ſo much that they liued moſt beaſtly with the people, whereby we might ſee that they were a moſt bloody &amp; tyranicall nation. But not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that they had thus butcherly prayed vpon their neighbours, and murthered them, 5. or 6. dayes after in deſpight of their enemies, they went vp &amp; downe the ſtreets bragging, with their weapons yet red with the blood of their enemies, for in ſuch bloody actions they take a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous pride, eſpecially that they had ſo well effected this bloody ſtratagem: yet not withſtanding this their mortal hatred, they buried the heads of their ſlayne enemies very honourably, the order whereof was thus. After that they were with their Gallies returned, the heads being orderly placed on a ſtaffe, faſtened thereunto (as before is ſaid) with a rope, they are brought before the houſe of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander</hi> or Gouernour, and laid vpon a great ſtone vnder a Tree, to the view of all the people, that they might ſee how valiantly they had behaued themſelues againſt their common enemies: whence (after they had ſo lien the ſpace of an houre) they were taken, and wrapped in Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, or cloth made of Cotton, and laid in a platter, &amp; ſo carried to the place of buriall: &amp; being put into the earth, they burnt great ſtore of franckenſence ouer the graues,
<pb facs="tcp:13461:38"/>
according to the manner and cuſtome of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when a man dyeth, the women that are <note place="margin">Their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies vſed ouer the dead.</note> alyed in friendſhip or kinred, weeping and lamenting, call and cry to the dead corps very loude, thinking with ſuch calling and mourning that the Courſe ſhall againe receiue life: but ſeeing that it remayneth dead, without mourning they prepare are a great Banquet, inuiting all their friendes, and ſuch as accompaned the dead corps to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, which is carried vpon mens ſhoulders, in ſuch ſort as is commonly vſed in our Countrey, but that they lay a white peece of Callikute ouer the dead: then is the corps followed to the Graue firſt by the men, and the women after: the dead being layd into the earth, they burne Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſence one whole day and night thereouer, put into a veſſel for that purpoſe: and vnder a penthouſe, or ſuch like, which is made ouer the graue, burneth a Lampe al night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the next day in the morning after the buriall, come thither all the common people, Gentlemen, and others, making their prayers ouer the Graue: which maner of ceremonie they keepe and obſerue for many dayes. Theſe things we ſaw and behelde with our eyes, and demaunded of them why they vſed ſuch kind of ceremonies: They anſwered interogatiuely, demaunding of vs if we did not the like when any died in our Countrey. We demaunded further, what they prayed ouer the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their anſwere was, that the dead might not riſe againe: which they ſteadfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, ſuppoſing that if they ſhould not ſo pray ouer the Graue of the dead, he would againe reuiue: ſuch is their lamentable miſbeliefe. In this Iland are many old folke, for their great yeeres very luſtie and well diſpoſed: for we <note place="margin">How the women im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them ſelues in their houſes</note> haue often times ſeene a man there of 130. yeeres old, yea and many others of great yeeres. They liue by the profit of their fruites, The women do there the worke &amp; labour, while the men walke idely vp and downe the ſtreetes:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13461:38"/>
they neuer walke abroade with their huſbandes, but keepe at home at their worke and buſineſſe, as drying of Nutmegs, and ſhaleing the ſame: wherein, and in other ſuch like, they imploy their time.</p>

It happened while we were there, that a boy of 11. or 12. yeares olde had ſtolen a leafe or two of Tabaco, wherewith he was taken, and led thorow the ſtreetes with his hands bound behinde him, after whom followed all the boyes of the towne mocking him, and crying in their language a théefe, a théefe. They are great enemies of the Portingals, for right ouer againſt this Iſland, lieth another Iſland called <hi>Tydore,</hi> planted with Portingals, they holde no quarter with each other, but kill one another like dogs, as it happened at our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, the 20. day of Iulie, 1599. at what time they of <hi>Ternate</hi> went out to the Iſland <hi>Tidore,</hi> where they on a ſudden ſet vpon a village, ſlew thrée of the inhabitance, and brought away 43. priſoners: among whom was a young man of 21. yeares olde, ſonne to the King of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores</hi> brother, who (after he had béen brought to the Kings preſence, and ſome ſpéeches vſed betwéene them) was lead out of the pallace with a rope about his necke vnto the ſea ſide, where hée was commaunded to waſh his hands: the young man ſtooping ſo to doe, one that ſtoode bebinde him, ſmote him on the backe with his Sable that he fell to the grounde, and preſently another man lent him another blowe, wherewith his lyuer and lungs hung out of his bodie. Hauing in this diſpitefull ſorte ſhewed their merciles hearts, the bodie was towed into the ſea, at the ſterne of a Praw or ſmall boate, and ſo ſuffered to driue away.

they make great ſorrowe and lamentation, ſuppoſing that their King (or ſome other of their chiefe men) ſhall dye (as we our ſelues ſawe the ſixt of Auguſt, about eyght of the clocke in the euening, the Moone then being eclypſed) the people kept ſuch a howling, praying, crying, and mourning in moſt hideous wiſe, with ſmiting vpon drummes and copper pans, as was moſt ſtraunge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde. Wherefore we demaunded of them the cauſe why they cried and mourned in ſuch ſorte, they anſwered vs, that the Moone was eclipſed, and that therefore their King, or ſome of his blood ſhould dye.

            <p>The 21. being <hi>A ſcention</hi> day, wee ſailed thence (with God his helpe) homewards, and being vnder ſaile, wée deſcried another Carrack making towards the Roade, which was the ſixt Carrack that we had now ſeene, wée directed our courſe Northweſt and by Weſt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, touching the Iſland of S. <hi>Helena,</hi> the ſame is a very fruitful and an healthſome land, with ſuch incredible multitude of fiſh in the Roade, that it may ſeeme a thing hardly to be beléued, the moſt part Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerell, and ſome other ſmall fiſhes, as Breames, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts which haue great eyes like vnto Haddocks, but their bodies more flat.</p>
            <p>The 25. of the ſame moneth wee were in thirtéene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, with a Northeſt winde, but it laſted not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it turned againe to the Southeſt, and ſo it continued for the moſt part after we were paſt the <hi>Cape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 30. day in the morning we had ſight of the Iſland called <hi>Aſcention,</hi> which lieth eight degrées Southward the Line, and the ſame euening we caſt our anchors neére to the ſhore thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſame night we ſet men aſhore to take view of the place, and the next morning wee ſent more of our people to ſearch and view all places, but found no freſh water, no not ſo much as one draft. This Iſland is full of ſtonie rocks &amp; holes, like vnto the ſinders of Sea-coales which are thorowly burnt: wee ſaw ſome Swine alſo in this Iſland, not without great marueile how they could there liue, for there is neither trée, leafe, nor graſſe, and that much more is, a man is not able to deſcribe the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and barrennes of the ground: but a man may there

with endgets hill plentie of Seamewes, although ſome ſtore of people remained there for a time. Alſo we tooke there ſome Torteſſes, whereof we brought foure aboord our ſhips, which were ſo great, that ſome of them were eſteemed to weigh foure hundred pound. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome reaſonable ſtore of fiſh to be taken.</p>
            <p>The laſt day of May in the euening wee wayed our anchors, hoyſed our ſailes, and departed from the Iſland <hi>Aſcention,</hi> with God his helpe, ſailing homewards with a fine gale from the Southeſt, ſhaping our courſe North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt and by Weſt.</p>
            <p>In the end, after great paynes, trauaile, and ſicknes, which we ſpecially ſuffered for want of freſh water, theſe two ſhips arriued in the <hi>Texell,</hi> and afterwards being diſcharged of our lading, we came with great comfort to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to the incredible ioye of the owners and Marchants (as may well be thought) ſeeing now all the eight ſhips were with great profit ſafely returned to to their wiſhed home, which had béen ſent out the firſt day of March 1598. in companie to the Iſlands of the Eaſt Indes. The Almightie God be bleſſed and praiſed therefore, who with his mightie hand gouerned and brought vs home tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the fearful waues, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging gulfes of the Sea.</p>
